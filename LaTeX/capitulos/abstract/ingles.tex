The present paper describes the development of the “\appName” software, which digitally emulates the modular synthesizer EMS Synthi 100 located at the Gabinete de Música Electroacústica de Cuenca. This software is implemented using the SuperCollider language (\textit{sclang}). It is meant to be an educational tool for the dissemination and discovery of the analog synthesizer, which is currently being restored and which fills a significant gap in the history of electroacoustic music around the world. Released with a free software license, it is accessible to all for musical or educational purposes. The dissertation provides a detailed description of how each emulated module functions, as well as each of the design decisions made throughout the process.
